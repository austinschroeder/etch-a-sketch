*Technologies used: <br>
HTML, CSS, Canvas, JavaScript, Adobe Photoshop*

I’m working on a web app that requires the use of HTML Canvas and this was a great way for me to learn about implementing it and working on my design chops.  Modeled off the old school Etch-A-Sketch toy that we all used as children.

•Uses Canvas API to draw and render lines how an Etch-A-Sketch pad would.<br>
•I made the design for this site using Adobe Photoshop and CSS.
